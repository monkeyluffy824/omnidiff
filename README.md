# omnidiff
This project is a lightweight Python library that implements reverse-mode automatic differentiation. It is designed as a learning-oriented extension of Andrej Karpathyâ€™s Micrograd, providing support for a broader range of mathematical operations and functions.

Similar to Micrograd, this library operates exclusively on scalar values, enabling a clear and intuitive understanding of the underlying mechanics of automatic differentiation.

In addition to computing gradients, you can use this library alone to construct and train neural networks, with a particular focus on binary classification tasks.

The gradients can be calculated for following functions:
Add,Sub,Multiply,Division,Absolute,sin,cos,tan,tanh,power,RELU,sigmod,ln,sqrt,gamma,softsign


<strong>Installation:</strong>

`pip install omnigrad`
